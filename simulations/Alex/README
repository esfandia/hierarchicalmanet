According to Alex, sometimes a simulation run slows down and effectlvely stalls. This seems
to happen in particular when simulating two clusters with intra-cluster mobility, at around
450 seconds of simulation time. While we have not been able to track down the cause of this,
changing the random number seed seems to do the trick in these cases. Alex claims that the
following seeds worked for his data collection:
682161
986355
626172
159447
772087

Also, in (almost?) all cases, after running the simulation, you will get an error message
about the simulation terminating with an error when closing the simulation output window.
Alex's thinking on this was the follwing: As long as the finisher module runs, the results 
should be collected even if you see some errors at the end when closing the simulation. 
The main error that I see when closing the simulation has something to do with the DHT timers. 
I think they occur because the simulation had some DHT messages that failed so a timer 
object is created to count the back off time. However, after the simulation is closed, 
these objects are not being disposed properly which causes some error messages to appear. 
To get the simulation results, they should appear as a .sca file in the results folder. 
The file name will usually be the simulation configuration that you ran by default. If you 
double click these file, a prompt will pop up asking you to create a analysis file (.anf). 
Opening the .anf file will allow you to view the result of the simulations.

The directory ~/Alex contains a PDF file with some screen shots on how to export the data 
from omnet++ into a CSV. It also has the matlab code that Alex used to process his data. 
It's not very pretty, but may be able to useful as a reference to begin developing one's
own scripting language or tools.
